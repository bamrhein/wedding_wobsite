Frontend webdev is such a giant ball of the inside of my ass. If I used a
framework or generator for this, it would be over 9000 lines of CSS/HTML.

Doing it manually is still very annoying. And it won't be "modular", because
fuuuuck all of that noise :V

That said, doing it like a 90s webdev is a big part of the charm. I want it
to be "coded" in the same style as its appearance.

Make it look like Geocities. Use tables. Don't do "modern" tricks
(at least where it makes sense).

Glad we had this talk.
