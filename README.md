A very cool Geocities-esque, Web 1.0 wobsite for our upcoming wedding!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Katie and I wanted to make a retro, Geocities-esque, Web 1.0 wobsite.
Here's what we came up with.

Given the style decision, I set out to implement the frontend to be as
"Web 1.0" as possible, which meant no frameworks and no responsive CSS.
However, that didn't last long because I really wanted it to look good
on mobile devices. So I added responsive CSS. No Bootstrap! :O

Another key design choice was to make the frontend work if the client
has JavaScript _disabled_. There is some inactive code in the project
to AJAXify the RSVP form if I later choose to, but I think re-rendering
the page better fits the overall aesthetic/design.

That said, there is a little bit of third-party JS for vanity features
like the sparkle cursor, per Katie's request. :)

The overall implementation is pretty straightforward and simple. I'm sure
a *real* frontend dev could do much better. Please do! I hate frontend!
