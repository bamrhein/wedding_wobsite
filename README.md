A very cool Geocities-esque, Web 1.0 wobsite for our upcoming wedding!

-----

Katie and I wanted to make a retro, Geocities-esque, Web 1.0 wobsite.
Here's what we came up with.

Given the style decision, I set out to implement the frontend to be as
"Web 1.0" as possible, which meant no frameworks and no responsive CSS.
That didn't last long, because I really wanted it to look good on
mobile devices. So I added responsive CSS. No Bootstrap! :O

I also threw in some third-party JS for vanity features like the
sparkle cursor and scrollbar, per Katie's request. ;)

The implementation is still pretty straightforward and simple. I'm sure
a *real* frontend dev could do much better. Please do! I hate frontend!
